## Design MIMO Predictive functional control in the form of PI-PD controller

# Abstract:

Consisting of a wide range of control methods, Predictive Control explicitly uses the process model to obtain control signals and minimize the target function.
The combination of predictive control and conventional controllers can cause significant increases in the efficiencies of these controllers.
In this research, a PI-PD controller was used on a two input-two output system that its parameters computed online with predictive controller. In this structure, the benefits of predictive controller and PI-PD controller are utilized. The studied system is a process of controlling the pressure of the champer in the coal extraction furnace that to describe it in PFC algorithm the expanded non-minimal state space model is used. 
Simulations indicated that the use of predictive functional control bore desirable results in the calculation of PI-PD control parameters. The proposed controller was compared to a non-minimal state space predictive functional control method and its superior performance was depicted quantitatively and qualitatively.

Keywords: Predictive functional control, PI-PD controller, two input-two output system, ENMSS.
